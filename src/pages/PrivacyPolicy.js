          <h2>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</h2>
          <p>
            To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights
            described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us
            by email at{' '}
            <a href={'mailto:' + process.env.HELP_EMAIL_ADDRESS}>
              {process.env.HELP_EMAIL_ADDRESS}

          <p>
            Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of
            State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a
            verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.
            You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your
            minor child.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data
            portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer
            request must:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify
              you are the person about whom we collected personal information or
              an authorized representative.
            </li>

            <li>
              Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to
              properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal
            information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make
            the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
            Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create
            an account with us. We will only use personal information provided
            in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity
            or authority to make the request.
          </p>

          <h1>California Do Not Track Disclosure</h1>
          <p>
            At this time because there currently isn’t an industry or legal
            standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, nor a common
            definition of “Tracking”, we do not respond to DNT Signals on any of
            the My Request websites (

            activities when they serve you continent, which enables them to
            tailor what they present to you if you are visiting such sites, your
            browser may have features that allow you to set the DNT signal on

          <h1>Response Timing and Format</h1>
          <p>
            We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45
            days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we
            will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If
            you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to
            that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver
            our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any
            disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding
            the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide
            will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if
            applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format
            to provide your personal information that is readily usable and
            should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to
            another entity without hindrance.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable
            consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly
            unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will
            tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost
            estimate before completing your request.
          </p>
